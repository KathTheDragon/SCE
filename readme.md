# SCE

SCE (standing for **Sound Change Engine**) is a tool for conlangers (people who make conlangs, or _constructed languages_) for automating the process of transforming words according to a list of rules. While these rules are modelled on the notation used by linguists for writing down regular sound changes, and modelling regular sound change is the primary purpose of SCE, as its name might suggest, the grammar is sufficiently powerful that many other types of transformation can be performed.
